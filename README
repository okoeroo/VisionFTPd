Project:  VisionFTPd
Licence:  MIT


The VisionFTPd tool is currently a hobby project of mine to explore networked control and data interface usage.


The first release will be called “Hydrogen”.

The VisionFTPd will be split into two thread types, a Commander and a Data-Mover. The Commander will serve a Virtual FileSystem (VFS) and make this accessible by use command or query protocol. The Data-Movers will serve data on its disk pool and push its hosted files and directories to the Commander. The Commander will control the Data-Movers to perform a networked task like performing the file transfer.

The Hydrogen release will serve as an unclustered FTP service.



The Helium release will improve on many things...
